                <p>NCI's Clinical Trials Reporting Program (CTRP) was established in response to a recommendation made by the NCI Clinical Trials Working Group (CTWG) to the National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB), and reiterated by the Institute of Medicineâ€™s (IOM) report titled A National Cancer Clinical Trials System for the 21st Century: Reinvigorating the NCI Cooperative Group Program</p>
